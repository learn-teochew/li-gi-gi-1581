Transcription of Teochew opera 《荔枝記》
====================================

The Teochew vernacular opera “Tale of the Lychee and Mirror”, also known as
“Dang San and Ngou Nio” 陳三五娘, is one of the most well known folk stories
and operas in Southern Min culture. This version was originally published in
1581 with the full title 《新刻增補全像鄉談荔枝記》. It is one of six printed
versions known from the Ming and Qing eras. Although the oldest extant edition,
published in 1566, usually receives the most attention, this version is also a
useful source for the history of Teochew vernacular language and culture.

This transcription is based on a [digital
scan](https://onb.digital//result/1037167F) of the original book held in the
Austrian National Library. The scan was released under a [No Copyright -
Non-Commercial Use
Only](https://rightsstatements.org/page/NoC-NC/1.0/?language=en) license, while
this transcription is released under a [Creative Commons
Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

Variant and simplified characters used in the original were transcribed as
closely to the original as possible, if the variant character is available in
Unicode. Otherwise, “ideographic description sequences” were used to describe
them. Lines starting with `>` are notes or explanations. Characters that I
could not find or was unsure of are represented as `X`, whereas characters that
were illegible or missing due to damage in the original are marked with `■`.

As the transcription is being proofread and edited, additional notes (e.g.
`TODO` and `STOP`) to mark points of progress may be left in the file.
